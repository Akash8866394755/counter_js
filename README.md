At last, I'm here to use the power of javascript to produce an incredibly amazing counter effect during the learning period.
I eventually experienced a counter effect when I visited a particular website to learn something new and create a new design.
Counting from zero to the number of numbers you want to count is the counter effect. I finally learned about the most amazing effect in javascript during my learning phase: the counter.
When I first started this project, it was harder for me since I tried a lot of different logics, but in the end, I wasted two hours and succeeded.
My sole goal is to create software with minimal latency.
